# # [Vortex ring](@id tutorial-vortex-ring)
#
# The following tutorial goes through the simulation of a **single vortex ring** propagating
# due to its self-induced propulsion.
#
# The aim is to show how one can:
#
# 1. Discretise a vortex filament using a spatial curve;
# 2. compute things like the self-induced vortex velocity;
# 3. simulate the motion of the vortex filament over a time period.
#
# We assume that VortexPasta and GLMakie have been installed following the instructions in
# the [Installation](@ref) section.
# The code in this tutorial should be executed in the same local environment where those
# packages were installed.
#
# ```@contents
# Pages = ["01-vortex_ring.md"]
# Depth = 2:3
# ```
#
# ## Defining a vortex ring
#
# The first thing to do is to define a circular vortex ring.
# In VortexPasta, curves are initialised using the [`Filaments.init`](@ref) function defined
# in the [`VortexPasta.Filaments`](@ref) submodule.
#
# The most straightforward way of defining an arbitrary curve is by first defining a set of
# discretisation points (which we also call *nodes*) and then passing that to `Filaments.init`.
# In VortexPasta, a point in 3D space is represented by the [`Vec3`](@ref
# VortexPasta.BasicTypes.Vec3) type (which is nothing else than an `SVector` from the
# [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) package).
#
# ### [Initialising the ring](@id tutorial-vortex-ring-init-filament)
#
# Let's define a set of points discretising a circular ring of radius ``R`` living on the
# plane ``z = 1`` and centred at ``\bm{x}_0 = [3, 3, 1]``:

using VortexPasta
using VortexPasta.Filaments
using VortexPasta.Filaments: Vec3

R = 2.0   # radius of the circular ring
N = 16    # number of discretisation points
x⃗₀ = Vec3(3.0, 3.0, 1.0)  # ring centre
θs = range(0, 2π; length = N + 1)[1:N]  # discretisation angles (we exclude θ = 2π)
points = [x⃗₀ + R * Vec3(cos(θ), sin(θ), 0) for θ ∈ θs]

# Now that we have defined a set of points, we can create a filament using `Filaments.init`.
# Note that this function requires choosing a **discretisation method** which will be used to
# interpolate the curve in-between nodes and to estimate curve derivatives.
# Here we use the [`QuinticSplineMethod`](@ref), which represents curves as **periodic
# quintic splines** (that is, piecewise polynomials of degree 5):

f = Filaments.init(ClosedFilament, points, QuinticSplineMethod())

# Other possible discretisation options are the [`CubicSplineMethod`](@ref) and
# [`FiniteDiffMethod`](@ref).
# The latter estimates derivatives at discretisation points using **finite differences**
# (based on the locations of neighbouring points), and performs Hermite interpolations using
# those derivatives to reconstruct the curve in-between nodes.
#
# Besides, note that the first argument ([`ClosedFilament`](@ref)) is mandatory and is only
# there to make sure that we're creating a *closed* (as opposed to an open-ended) filament.
# This means in particular that the filament will be automatically "closed" when evaluated
# outside of its range of definition `1:N`.
# For example, one has `f[1] == f[N + 1]`:

@show f[1] f[N] f[N + 1]
nothing  # hide

# ### Getting geometric information out of a filament
#
# Above we have used the `f[i]` syntax to obtain the location of a discretisation point.
# As mentioned, curve locations can also be evaluated in-between discretisation points
# using **interpolation**.
# For instance, to evaluate the curve location at some point in-between nodes `i` and `i +
# 1`, one can call `f(i, ζ)`, where `ζ` is some real value between 0 and 1.
# In particular, `f(i, 0.5)` gives an estimation of the midpoint between both nodes,
# while `f(i, 0.0)` and `f(i, 1.0)` respectively correspond to `f[i]` and `f[i + 1]`:

i = 2
@show f[i] f(i, 0.0) f(i, 0.5) f(i, 1.0) f[i + 1]
nothing  # hide

# A similar syntax can be used to obtain **derivatives** at discretisation points or
# in-between them:

@show f[i] f[i, Derivative(1)] f[i, Derivative(2)]
@show f(i, 0.5) f(i, 0.5, Derivative(1)) f(i, 0.5, Derivative(2))
nothing  # hide

# These derivatives assume that curves are parametrised as ``\bm{s}(t)`` for ``t ∈ [0, T]``,
# and are computed with respect to this parameter.
# In practice, the parameter ``t`` roughly corresponds to the integrated arc length (and
# thus ``T`` is a rough estimation of the total curve length), but this should never be
# assumed.
# In particular, the first derivative ``∂\bm{s}/∂t`` is tangent to the curve but it's not
# necessarily unitary (which would be the case if ``t`` was the actual arc length ``ξ``).
#
# In some cases, one may want to directly obtain geometrically-relevant quantities such as
# the unit tangent or the curvature vector (see [Geometric quantities](@ref) for definitions
# and a list of possible quantities):

t̂ = f[i, UnitTangent()]       # "t̂" can be typed by t\hat<tab>
ρ⃗ = f[i, CurvatureVector()]   # "ρ⃗" can be typed by \rho<tab>\vec<tab>
@show t̂ ρ⃗
nothing  # hide

# We can check that both vectors are orthogonal and that their respective norms are 1 and
# approximately ``1/R`` (where ``R`` is the vortex ring radius):

using LinearAlgebra: norm, ⋅  # the dot product ̇`⋅` can be obtained via \cdot<tab>
@show t̂ ⋅ ρ⃗ norm(t̂) norm(ρ⃗) 1/R
nothing  # hide

# ### Plotting the filament

# We can readily plot our vortex ring using Makie.
# For convenience, VortexPasta overloads the Makie `plot` and `plot!` functions to be able
# to directly plot filaments.

using GLMakie
set_theme!(theme_black())
GLMakie.activate!()  # hide
Makie.inline!(true)  # hide
fig = Figure()                         # create an empty figure
ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect = :data)  # add an Axis3 for plotting in 3D
zlims!(ax, 0.5, 1.5)                   # set axis limits in the z direction
plot!(ax, f)                           # plot filament onto axis
fig                                    # display the figure

# Note that, by default, the plot simply shows the ``N`` filament nodes (circular markers)
# joined by straight lines.
# To see how points are actually interpolated in-between nodes we can use the `refinement`
# keyword argument:

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect = :data)
zlims!(ax, 0.5, 1.5)
plot!(ax, f; refinement = 4)
fig

# It is also possible to plot other quantities such as the estimated tangent and curvature
# vectors along the curve:

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect = :data)
zlims!(ax, 0.5, 1.5)
plot!(
    ax, f;
    refinement = 4, linewidth = 4, markersize = 12,
    tangents = true, tangentcolor = :Yellow,         # plot tangent vectors
    curvatures = true, curvaturecolor = :LightBlue,  # plot curvature vectors
    arrowwidth = 0.03, arrowscale = 1.2, arrowsize = (1, 1, 1.2) .* 0.1,  # arrow properties
    vectorpos = 0.5,    # plot vectors at the midpoint in-between nodes
)

# ## Computing the vortex ring velocity
#
# An isolated vortex ring of radius ``R`` and circulation ``Γ`` is known to translate with a
# velocity [Saffman1993](@cite):
# ```math
# v_{\text{ring}} = \frac{Γ}{4πR} \left[ \ln \left(\frac{8R}{a}\right) - Δ \right],
# ```
# where ``a`` is the radius of the vortex core -- assumed to be much smaller than ``R`` --
# and ``Δ`` is a coefficient which depends on the actual vorticity profile at the core.
#
# !!! note "Some typical values of Δ"
#
#     - ``Δ = 1/2`` for a **hollow vortex**: ``ω(r) = ω₀ \, δ(r - a)``;
#     - ``Δ = 1/4`` for a **uniform vorticity distribution**: ``ω(r) = ω₀`` for ``r < a``.
#
# This velocity can be derived by computing the Biot--Savart integral along the circular
# vortex ring and excluding a very small region (proportional to ``a``) from the integral,
# in the vicinity of the point of interest, thus avoiding the singularity.
#
# In VortexPasta, the velocity induced by one or more vortex filaments is computed by the
# [`VortexPasta.BiotSavart`](@ref) submodule.
# The basic steps for computing the velocity induced by a set of vortices on itself is:
#
# 1. Set physical and numerical parameters ([`ParamsBiotSavart`](@ref)),
# 2. initialise a "cache" containing arrays and data needed for computations
#    ([`BiotSavart.init_cache`](@ref)),
# 3. compute filament velocities from their positions ([`velocity_on_nodes!`](@ref)).
#
# ### Physical and numerical parameters
#
# Before being able to estimate the vortex ring velocity, we need to set the parameters
# needed to estimate Biot--Savart integrals.
# All of the required and optional parameters are described in [`ParamsBiotSavart`](@ref).
#
# Relevant **physical parameters** are of two types:
#
# - **vortex properties**: circulation ``Γ``, core radius ``a`` and core parameter ``Δ``;
# - **domain size** (or period) ``L``.

Γ = 1.0    # vortex circulation                              || "Γ" can be typed by \Gamma<tab>
a = 1e-8   # vortex core size
Δ = 1/2    # vortex core parameter (1/2 for a hollow vortex) || "Δ" can be typed by \Delta<tab>
L = 2π     # domain period (same in all directions in this case)
nothing  # hide

# Note that here we work with nondimensional quantities, but we could try to relate these
# physical parameters to actual properties of, say, liquid helium-4.
# In this case, the vortex core size is ``a ≈ 10^{-8}\,\text{cm}`` and the quantum of
# circulation is ``Γ = κ = h/m ≈ 0.997 × 10^{-3}\,\text{cm}^2/\text{s}``, where ``h`` is
# Planck's constant and ``m`` the mass of a helium atom.
# So the above parameters can be relevant to ``^4\text{He}`` if one interprets lengths
# in centimetres and the time unit is about 1000 seconds.
#
# There are also important **numerical parameters** which need to be set.
# See the [Parameter selection](@ref Ewald-parameters) section for an advice on how to set
# them.
#
# Following that page, we start by setting the resolution ``M`` of the numerical grid used
# for long-range computations and the accuracy parameter ``β``, and we set the other
# parameters based on that:

M = round(Int, 64 * 4/5)  # we prefer if the FFT size is a power of 2, here M′ = σM = 64 (where σ = 1.25)
kmax = π * M / L          # this is the maximum resolved wavenumber (the Nyquist frequency)
β = 3.5                   # non-dimensional accuracy parameter
α = kmax / (2β)           # Ewald splitting parameter || "α" can be typed by "\alpha<tab>"
rcut = β / α              # cut-off distance for short-range computations
rcut / L                  # note: the cut-off distance should be less than half the period L

# Additionally, we can optionally set the parameters for numerical integration.
# In particular, we can set the quadrature rule used to approximate line integrals within each filament
# segment (see [Numerical integration](@ref)):

quadrature = GaussLegendre(3)  # use 3-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature
nothing  # hide

# See [`GaussLegendre`](@ref) or the [Wikipedia
# page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature#Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_quadrature) for more details.
#
# Finally, we put all these parameters together in a [`ParamsBiotSavart`](@ref) object:

using VortexPasta.BiotSavart
params = ParamsBiotSavart(;
    Γ, α, Δ, a,
    Ls = (L, L, L),  # same domain size in all directions
    Ns = (M, M, M),  # same long-range resolution in all directions
    rcut,
    quadrature,
)

# Note that there are a few parameters, namely the short-range and long-range backends,
# which haven't been discussed yet.
# These correspond to different ways of computing both components.
# We leave them here at their default values.
# See [`CellListsBackend`](@ref) and [`NonuniformFFTsBackend`](@ref) for details on the defaults
# and their parameters.

# ### Computing the velocity on filament nodes
#
# The last thing to do before launching computations is to create a "cache" where all data
# (arrays, …) required for computations are kept.
# This is in part to avoid making large allocations every time we wish to compute
# Biot--Savart integrals, which would be quite bad for performance.
# Luckily, creating a cache is very simple:

fs = [f]  # note: we need to pass a *vector* of filaments
cache = BiotSavart.init_cache(params, fs)
nothing  # hide

# We can now estimate the velocity of all filament nodes using [`velocity_on_nodes!`](@ref).
# But first we need to allocate the output, which will contain all velocities:

vs = map(similar ∘ nodes, fs)
@show summary(vs) summary(vs[1])
nothing  # hide

# Note that this is a 1-element vector (because we only have 1 filament).
# Moreover, the element `vs[1]` is a vector of [`Vec3`](@ref) (3-element vectors,
# specifically velocity vectors in this case), in which the element
# `vs[1][i]` will be the velocity of the filament node `fs[1][i]`.
#
# To actually fill `vs` with the velocities of the filament nodes, we call
# [`velocity_on_nodes!`](@ref):

velocity_on_nodes!(vs, cache, fs)
vs[1]  # prints the velocities of all nodes of the first (and only) filament

# We have done our first Biot--Savart calculation!
# We can see that all nodes have practically zero velocity in the ``x`` and ``y``
# directions, while they all have approximately the same velocity in the ``z`` direction.
# Good news, this is exactly what we expect for a vortex ring!
#
# We can compute the mean velocity and quantify the velocity variation along the filament:

using Statistics: mean, std
v_mean = mean(vs[1])
v_std = std(vs[1])
v_std_normalised = v_std / norm(v_mean)  # normalised standard deviation
@show v_mean v_std v_std_normalised
nothing  # hide

# Note that there are some (very small) fluctuations of the velocity about the mean.
# As discussed and verified further below, this is explained by periodicity effects, as the
# vortex ring is affected by its periodic images.
# Furthermore, different points along the ring are at different distances from the images,
# and therefore the velocity induced by the images varies slightly as we move along the
# vortex ring.
# In other words, periodicity introduces a slight anisotropy on the behaviour of the vortex ring.
#
# To visualise things, it is easy to plot the filament with the node velocities:

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect = :data)
zlims!(ax, 0.5, 1.5)
plot!(
    ax, fs[1], vs[1];
    refinement = 4,
    arrowscale = 0.2, arrowwidth = 0.02, arrowsize = (0.08, 0.08, 0.10),
)
fig

# ### Comparison with analytical expression
#
# We can finally compare the filament velocity with the analytical vortex ring velocity
# according to the expression at the [start of this section](@ref
# Computing-the-vortex-ring-velocity):

v_ring = Γ / (4π * R) * (log(8R / a) - Δ)
vz = v_mean[3]
relative_difference = (v_ring - vz) / v_ring
@show v_ring vz relative_difference
nothing  # hide

# We can see that we're quite close, and that the relative difference between the two is of
# the order of 5%.
# This is already nice, but note that most of the difference may be explained by
# **periodicity effects**, as shown in more detail in the [next section](@ref
# ring-disabling-periodicity).
# Indeed, the vortex ring is not alone, but is also affected by its periodic images.
#
# We can visualise this by plotting the ring and its nearest 26 periodic images (actually
# there's an infinity of them!):

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect = :data)
hidespines!(ax)
hidexdecorations!(ax; label = false)
hideydecorations!(ax; label = false)
hidezdecorations!(ax; label = false)
fimage = copy(f)
plot!(ax, f; refinement = 4, markersize = 0, color = :OrangeRed, linewidth = 2)
for I ∈ CartesianIndices((-1:1, -1:1, -1:1))
    local widths = (L, L, L)
    local offset = Vec3(Tuple(I) .* widths)
    local box = Rect(offset..., widths...)
    wireframe!(ax, box; color = (:white, 0.5), linewidth = 0.2)  # plot cube
    iszero(I) && continue  # don't replot the "original" filament
    fimage .= f .+ Ref(offset)
    update_coefficients!(fimage)  # updates interpolation coefficients
    plot!(ax, fimage; refinement = 4, markersize = 0, color = :LightBlue, linewidth = 1)
end
fig

# One can show that the images have the tendency to slow the vortex down, which is
# consistent with our results (since `vz < v_ring`).
# The effect here is relatively important because the ring diameter ``2R`` is comparable to the
# domain period ``L``:

2R/L

# We can expect the periodicity effect on the ring to be much weaker for smaller rings.

# ### [Side note: disabling periodicity](@id ring-disabling-periodicity)
#
# It is actually possible to disable the periodic boundary conditions, effectively leading
# to an open domain with a unique vortex ring.
#
# In VortexPasta.jl, disabling periodicity amounts to disabling the long-range part of Ewald
# summation, so that **all** scales are computed by the "short"-range component.
# The cut-off distance is therefore infinity, and it makes no sense to use cell lists to
# accelerate the computations.
# Other methods exist (and are now standard) to accelerate this kind of computation, but
# these are not implemented here.
# So, while it is possible to disable periodicity, this should only be used for testing or
# for small calculations.
#
# To disable periodicity, one should pass `α = Zero()` and `Ls = Infinity()` to
# [`ParamsBiotSavart`](@ref):

params_inf = ParamsBiotSavart(;
    Γ, α = Zero(), Δ, a,
    Ls = Infinity(),
    quadrature,
)

# Here [`Zero`](@ref) and [`Infinity`](@ref) are custom types that, as one may expect,
# represent ``0`` and ``+∞``.
#
# We can now compute the vortex ring velocity in the absence of periodic effects:

cache_inf = BiotSavart.init_cache(params_inf, fs)
vs_inf = map(similar, vs)
velocity_on_nodes!(vs_inf, cache_inf, fs)
v_mean_inf = mean(vs_inf[1])
v_std_inf = std(vs_inf[1])
v_std_normalised_inf = v_std_inf / norm(v_mean_inf)
@show v_mean_inf v_std_inf v_std_normalised_inf
nothing  # hide

# The velocity fluctuations along the filament are now practically zero!
# This should be contrasted with the standard deviation of about ``0.001`` we obtained in
# the periodic case.
# This is consistent with what was explained on the anisotropy introduced by periodicity,
# in the sense that not all points on the filament "feel" the effect of the periodic images
# in the same way.
#
# Moreover, the mean velocity is even closer to the analytical velocity:

vz_inf = v_mean_inf[3]
relative_difference_inf = (v_ring - vz_inf) / v_ring

# The relative difference is reduced from 5% to about 0.01%!
# Once again, this clearly shows that periodic images have some (very minor) impact on the effective
# vortex ring velocity.
#
# Note that we could further reduce the difference with the analytical result by increasing
# the filament resolution ``N``. The results also depend on the chosen discretisation
# scheme: [`QuinticSplineMethod`](@ref) allows to accurately describe the circular vortex
# ring geometry (and [`FourierMethod`](@ref) even more so), while methods like
# [`CubicSplineMethod`](@ref) and [`FiniteDiffMethod`](@ref) are less accurate.

# ## Making the ring move
#
# Up to now we have shown how to compute the velocity self-induced by a vortex filament on
# its discretisation points.
# We now want to use this velocity to advect the vortex filament over time.
# In the case of a vortex ring, its displacement is very simple and boring (the vortex ring
# moves with constant velocity), but this case is still useful for instance for testing the
# stability of timestepping schemes.
#
# For running temporal simulations, we want to use the [`VortexPasta.Timestepping`](@ref)
# submodule.
# The syntax is somewhat inspired from the popular
# [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/) ecosystem.
#
# ### A basic simulation
#
# We start by defining a [`VortexFilamentProblem`](@ref), which takes (1) an initial condition
# (in our case, the initial vortex ring we already defined); (2) the time span of the
# simulation; and (3) parameters for Biot--Savart computations (which we already defined as well):

using VortexPasta.Timestepping
T = L / 2vz       # time it should take for the ring to cross half the periodic box
tspan = (0.0, T)  # time span; this basically determines when to stop the simulation
prob = VortexFilamentProblem(fs, tspan, params)

# The second step is to "initialise" the problem using [`init`](@ref init(::VortexFilamentProblem)).
# This means choosing a [temporal scheme](@ref Temporal-schemes), an initial timestep, as
# well as optional parameters related for instance to [temporal adaptivity](@ref
# Adaptivity), [spatial refinement](@ref Refinement) of the filaments, or [vortex
# reconnections](@ref Reconnections).
#
# For now, we use the explicit [`RK4`](@ref) timestepping scheme, set a constant timestep
# `dt`, and leave the defaults for everything else:

l_min = minimum_knot_increment(fs)       # this is an estimate for the minimum distance between discretisation points
dt = 3 * l_min^2 / (Γ * log(l_min / a))  # we set the timestep to be proportional to some characteristic "fast" timescale
iter = init(prob, RK4(); dt)

# Note that the maximum possible timestep to avoid numerical instability is mainly limited
# by the filament resolution ``ℓ_{\text{min}}``.
# More precisely, the limit is the frequency of spurious oscillations associated to that
# length scale.
# These correspond to Kelvin waves, whose frequency roughly scales as
# ``ω(ℓ) ∼ Γ \ln (ℓ / a) / ℓ^2``.
# See the [Kelvin wave tutorial](@ref tutorial-kelvin-waves-timestep) for more details.
#
# !!! note "Adaptive timestepping"
#
#     One can use adaptive timestepping with the [`AdaptBasedOnSegmentLength`](@ref)
#     criterion, which automatically updates the timestep based on the current minimal
#     distance between filament nodes.
#
# We now call [`solve!`](@ref) to run the simulation until ``t = T = L / 2 v_{\text{ring}}``:

solve!(iter)  # run the simulation until t = T
iter.t / T    # check that the current time is t == T

# We can check that, as expected, the ring has crossed half the periodic box:

displacement = @. (iter.fs - prob.fs) / L
displacement[1]  # prints displacement of the first (and only) filament

# As we can see, the filament nodes have basically only moved in the ``z`` direction by
# almost exactly ``L / 2``.
#
# ### [Accessing the instantaneous simulation state](@id tutorial-vortex-ring-simulation-state)
#
# Above we have simply run a simulation from start to finish, without caring about what
# happened in-between.
# In reality, one usually wants to be able to do things with the intermediate states, for
# instance, to track the evolution of the total vortex length, the energy, or simply to
# make nice movies.
#
# There are two ways of doing this, both inspired by DifferentialEquations.jl (see
# [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/integrator/) and
# [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/features/callback_functions/#Using-Callbacks)):
#
# #### 1. Using the integrator interface
#
# This option is actually quite intuitive.
# The idea is to explicitly iterate timestep by timestep (typically using a `for` or `while`
# loop) until we decide it's time to stop.
# At each iteration we perform a simulation timestep (going from ``t_n`` to ``t_{n + 1} =
# t_n + Δt``), and then we can do whatever we want with the instantaneous solution contained
# in `iter`.
#
# Note that, in this case, the time span defined in the [`VortexFilamentProblem`](@ref) is
# completely ignored, meaning that we can stop the simulation whenever we want.
#
# To use this interface, we create the solver in the same way as before, and then we
# advance the solver one timestep at a time using [`step!`](@ref).
# For instance, we can choose to stop when we have performed 20 timesteps.
# And every 5 timestep we print some information:

iter = init(prob, RK4(); dt)
while iter.nstep ≤ 20
    ## Print the time and the mean location of the vortex ring every 5 solver iterations.
    local dt  # avoid "soft scope" warning
    (; nstep, t, dt,) = iter
    if nstep % 5 == 0
        Xavg = mean(iter.fs[1])
        println("- step = $nstep, t = $t, dt = $dt")
        println("  Average ring location: ", Xavg)
    end
    step!(iter)  # run a single timestep
end

# #### 2. Using callbacks
#
# We can do the same using a callback.
# This is a function which gets called at each solver iteration with the current state of
# the solver.
#
# The idea is to create such a function which receives a single `iter` argument.
# Then we tell [`init`](@ref) to use this function as a callback, and use [`solve!`](@ref)
# as we did earlier to run the simulation until the end time:

## Prints the time and the mean location of the vortex ring every 5 solver iterations.
function print_solver_info(iter)
    (; nstep, t, dt,) = iter
    if nstep % 5 == 0
        Xavg = mean(iter.fs[1])
        println("- step = $nstep, t = $t, dt = $dt")
        println("  Average ring location: ", Xavg)
    end
end
iter = init(prob, RK4(); dt, callback = print_solver_info)
solve!(iter)
nothing  # hide

# Note that the callback is also called once when the solver is initialised (when `nstep =
# 0`).
#
# ### Making an animation
#
# We can use either of the two methods above to create a video of the moving vortex.
# Here we will use Makie to create the animation.
# See the [Makie docs on animations](https://docs.makie.org/stable/explanations/animation/)
# for more details.
#
# In this example we will use the integrator interface.
# We start by initialising the solver and creating a plot with to the initial condition:

# Note that here we have used [`record`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/api/#record) and
# [`recordframe!`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/api/#recordframe!) to generate a movie file,
# but these are not needed if one just wants to see things moving in real time as the
# simulation runs.

# ![](vortex_ring.mp4)

# ## Saving state to disk
#
# It is often useful to be able to save the solver state to disk, for instance to be able to
# restart a simulation from that state or to analyse the data.
# In VortexPasta this is possible using the [`VortexPasta.FilamentIO`](@ref) submodule,
# which defines functions for writing (and reading back) vortex filament data.
#
# Data is written in the HDF5 format, which is a binary format that can be easily explored
# using command-line tools or the HDF5 interfaces available in many different programming
# languages.
# More precisely, data is written to [VTK HDF
# files](https://docs.vtk.org/en/latest/design_documents/VTKFileFormats.html#hdf-file-formats),
# which are HDF5 files with a specific organisation that can be readily understood by
# visualisation tools such as ParaView.
# In other words, simulation outputs can be readily visualised without the need to convert
# them or to have a "translation" file explaining how to visualise the binary data.
#
# !!! note "VTK HDF file extension"
#
#     ParaView doesn't recognise the usual `.h5` file extension as a VTK HDF file.
#     For this reason, it is recommended to use `.vtkhdf` if one wants to visualise the data.
#
# ### Writing filament data and reading it back
#
# Writing filament data is done via the [`write_vtkhdf`](@ref) function:

using VortexPasta.FilamentIO
write_vtkhdf("vortex_ring_initial.vtkhdf", fs)  # write filament locations to disk

# This creates an HDF5 file with the following structure:
#
# ```bash
# $ h5ls -r vortex_ring_initial.vtkhdf
# /                                     Group
# /VTKHDF                               Group
# /VTKHDF/Lines/Connectivity            Dataset {17}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/NumberOfCells           Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/NumberOfConnectivityIds Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/Offsets                 Dataset {2}
# /VTKHDF/NumberOfPoints                Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Points                        Dataset {17, 3}
# /VTKHDF/RefinementLevel               Dataset {SCALAR}
# [...]
# ```
#
# (The `[...]` includes the `Polygons`, `Strips` and `Vertices` groups which are just there
# to make ParaView happy.)
# Note that everything is written to a `VTKHDF` group.
# In this case, we have a single cell which corresponds to our vortex ring (one VTK cell
# corresponds to one vortex filament).
# The important datasets here are `Points`, which contains the discretisation points of all
# filaments, and `Lines/Offsets`, which allows to identify which point corresponds to which
# vortex.
# See [`write_vtkhdf`](@ref) for more details.
#
# The generated files can be read back using [`read_vtkhdf`](@ref):

fs_read = read_vtkhdf("vortex_ring_initial.vtkhdf", Float64, CubicSplineMethod())
fs_read == fs

# ### Visualising VTK HDF files
#
# Opening this file in ParaView should produce something like this:
#
# ![](paraview_vortex_ring.png)
#
# Things look quite rough since, by default, we only export the discretisation points, which
# ParaView connects by straight lines.
# As with Makie plots, we can make things look nicer by passing the `refinement` argument:

write_vtkhdf("vortex_ring_initial_refined.vtkhdf", fs; refinement = 4)

# ![](paraview_vortex_ring_ref4.png)

# ### Attaching more data
#
# It can also be useful to include other data associated to the filaments, such as the
# velocity of the discretisation points.
# One can also easily add geometric quantities along filaments (see
# [`GeometricQuantity`](@ref Filaments.GeometricQuantity) for a list of possible options).
#
# As an example, we can save the positions, velocities, streamfunction, local curvature
# vector and time values corresponding to the final state of our last simulation:

write_vtkhdf("vortex_ring_final.vtkhdf", iter.fs; refinement = 4) do io
    io["velocity"] = iter.vs
    io["streamfunction"] = iter.ψs
    io["curvatures"] = CurvatureVector()  # note: no need to explicitly compute curvatures!
    io["time"] = iter.t
end

# The HDF5 file structure now looks like:
#
# ```bash
# $ h5ls -r vortex_ring_final.vtkhdf
# /                                     Group
# /VTKHDF                               Group
# /VTKHDF/FieldData                     Group
# /VTKHDF/FieldData/time                Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/Connectivity            Dataset {65}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/NumberOfCells           Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/NumberOfConnectivityIds Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/Lines/Offsets                 Dataset {2}
# /VTKHDF/NumberOfPoints                Dataset {1}
# /VTKHDF/PointData                     Group
# /VTKHDF/PointData/curvatures          Dataset {65, 3}
# /VTKHDF/PointData/streamfunction      Dataset {65, 3}
# /VTKHDF/PointData/velocity            Dataset {65, 3}
# /VTKHDF/Points                        Dataset {65, 3}
# /VTKHDF/RefinementLevel               Dataset {SCALAR}
# [...]
# ```
#
# Note that a `PointData` group has been created with two datasets: `streamfunction` and
# `velocity`.
# These correspond to data attached to the filaments, and have the same dimensions as the
# `Points` dataset.
# These can be readily visualised in ParaView.
# Besides, a `FieldData` group has been created with the `time` dataset.
# In VTK, "field data" corresponds to values that are not directly attached to the geometry,
# such as scalar quantities in this case.
#
# Loading the attached data is done in a similar way (see [`read_vtkhdf`](@ref) for
# details):

vs_read = map(similar ∘ nodes, fs)
ψs_read = map(similar ∘ nodes, fs)
fs_read = read_vtkhdf("vortex_ring_final.vtkhdf", Float64, CubicSplineMethod()) do io
    read!(io, vs_read, "velocity")
    read!(io, ψs_read, "streamfunction")
    local t_read = read(io, "time", FieldData(), Float64)  # note: this is read as an array
    @show t_read
end
@show (fs_read ≈ iter.fs) (vs_read == iter.vs) (ψs_read == iter.ψs)
nothing  # hide

# Note that, when reading "refined" datasets, only the original discretisation points and
# data on them are read back.
# The points and data added in-between nodes for refinement purposes are discarded.
