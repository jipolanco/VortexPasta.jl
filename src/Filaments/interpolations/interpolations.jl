Interpolate coordinates ``\\bm{X}(t)`` or their derivatives at a given
location ``t``.

Under this form, the location ``t`` must be normalised such that the interval of
interest is in ``t âˆˆ [0, 1]``. Note that input and output derivatives must also
be normalised accordingly.

The `values_at_interpolation_points` depend on the interpolation method:

- for [`HermiteInterpolation`](@ref), one should pass the coordinates
  ``\\bm{X}`` and the first ``M`` derivatives at the two endpoints of the interval
  (``t = 0`` and ``1``).
