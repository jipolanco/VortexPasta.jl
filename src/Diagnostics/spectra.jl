    energy_spectrum(iter::VortexFilamentSolver) -> (ks, Ek)
    energy_spectrum(cache) -> (ks, Ek)

Compute kinetic energy spectrum associated to vortex filament state.

Returns a tuple of vectors `(ks, Ek)` where `ks` contains the probed wavenumbers and `Ek`
the energy associated to each wavenumber.

See also [`energy_spectrum!`](@ref) for a non-allocating variant and for more details.
"""
function energy_spectrum end

"""
    energy_spectrum!(Ek::AbstractVector, ks::AbstractVector, cache)

Compute kinetic energy spectrum associated to vortex filament state.

Here `cache` contains the results of long-range Biot–Savart computations. It can be either:

- a [`LongRangeCache`](@ref);
- a [`BiotSavartCache`](@ref) (which contains a `LongRangeCache`);
- a `VortexFilamentSolver` from the `Timestepping` module (which contains a `BiotSavartCache`).

The energy spectrum is computed from a recent Biot–Savart calculation using fast Ewald
summation. More precisely, it is computed from the (Fourier-truncated) velocity field in
Fourier space. The [`LongRangeCache`](@ref) associated to the calculation is expected to
currently contain this field.

The cache can also contain the vorticity field in Fourier space (the result
obtained right after performing a NUFFT from the filament locations, see
[`BiotSavart.compute_vorticity_fourier!`](@ref). In this case this function does the right
thing and also computes the spectrum of the associated velocity field.

The vectors `Ek` and `ks` are expected to have the same length. Moreover, the vector of
wavenumbers `ks` should satisfy `ks[begin] == 0` and have a constant step
`Δk = ks[i + 1] - ks[i]`. For convenience, the [`init_spectrum`](@ref) function can
be used to create these vectors.

See also [`energy_spectrum`](@ref) for an allocating variant which doesn't need predefined
`Ek` and `ks` vectors.

    Diagnostics.init_spectrum(iter::VortexFilamentSolver) -> (ks, Ek)

Initialise fields for storing an energy or helicity spectrum.

Returns a wavenumber vector `ks` and an uninitialised spectrum `Ek` with the right
dimensions, which can be then passed to [`energy_spectrum!`](@ref) or [`helicity_spectrum!](@ref).

The returned arrays are always on the CPU, even when the `cache` contains GPU data.
