    energy_flux(iter::VortexFilamentSolver, Nk::Integer; quad = nothing) -> (ks, fluxes)
    energy_flux(iter::VortexFilamentSolver, ks::AbstractVector; quad = nothing) -> (ks, fluxes)

Compute the energy "flux" across scales due to various velocity terms.

The second argument can be either the wanted number of output wavenumbers `Nk`, or the
actual output wavenumbers `ks`. In the first case, this function will choose
logarithmically-spaced wavenumbers `ks` across which the fluxes will be computed.
In general, the length of `ks` will be slightly lower than `Nk` to avoid possible
repetitions.

Note that the cost of computing the fluxes across each wavenumber is very high
(we basically perform one NUFFT per wavenumber), so `Nk` should not be too large,
and this function should not be called too often.

This function returns:

- `ks::AbstractVector`: a vector of wavenumbers;

- `fluxes::NamedTuple`: a list of energy fluxes across scales due to different velocity terms.
  Each element is a vector of real values.
  For example, `fluxes.vs` is a vector containing the energy flux across scales due to the
  Biot–Savart velocity (see Extended help below).

# Extended help

Depending on the fields available in `iter`, the returned `fluxes` can include the fields:

- `vs`: energy flux across scale ``k`` due to the Biot–Savart self-induced velocity;

- `vinf`: estimated non-local energy flux from scales ``≤ k`` to scales ``k ∼ ∞``;

- `vf`: accumulated energy injection rate (by external forcing term) up to scale ``k``;

- `vdiss`: accumulated energy dissipation rate (by external dissipation term) up to scale ``k``.

Note that all of these fluxes are properly signed according to the usual convention (i.e. they are ready to plot).
In particular, both `vf` and `vdiss` are positive if the respective terms inject and
dissipate energy as expected, while `vs` is positive in the presence of a direct energy cascade.

## Definitions

The energy flux (`fluxes.vs`) across scale ``k`` is defined as:

```math
Π_k = - \frac{Γ}{V} ∮ \left[ \bm{s}' × \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<} \right] ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{s}} \, \mathrm{d}ξ,
```

where ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}`` is the self-induced vortex velocity (according to the Biot–Savart law)
and the superscript ``<`` denotes a low-pass filter up to scale ``k``.
Note that this looks very similar to the [`energy_injection_rate`](@ref) definition, and
this is because ``Π_k`` can indeed be interpreted as the dissipation of large-scale energy
(associated to ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<}``) by the full Biot–Savart velocity ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}``.

Similarly, the estimated non-local energy flux (`fluxes.vinf`) from scales ``≤ k`` to scales ``k ∼ ∞``
is defined as:

```math
\begin{align}
Π_k^{∞}
&= - \frac{Γ}{V} ∮ \left[ \bm{s}' × \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<} \right] ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{∞} \, \mathrm{d}ξ
\\
&= - \frac{Γ^2}{4π V} ∮ \bm{s}'' ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<} \, \mathrm{d}ξ,
\end{align}
```

where ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{∞} ≡ \frac{Γ}{4π} \bm{s}' × \bm{s}''`` is an estimate for the
"singular" part of the self-induced velocity, associated to very high wavenumbers ``k``.
This is only an estimate which allows to have an idea of the non-local energy transfers from
large to small scales. Also note the close similarity of this expression with the filament
stretching rate (see [`stretching_rate`](@ref)). Indeed, ``Π_k^{∞}`` is proportional to the
increase of filament length due to the large-scale velocity ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<}``.

If an external dissipation term is included, the accumulated energy dissipation rate (`fluxes.vdiss`) is given by:

```math
D_k = - \frac{Γ}{V} ∮ \left[ \bm{s}' × \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<} \right] ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{diss}} \, \mathrm{d}ξ,
```

where ``\bm{v}_{\text{diss}}`` is the dissipative velocity.

Finally, the accumulated energy injection rate (`fluxes.vf`) is (note the ``+`` sign!):

```math
F_k = + \frac{Γ}{V} ∮ \left[ \bm{s}' × \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{<} \right] ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{f}} \, \mathrm{d}ξ,
```

where ``\bm{v}_{\text{f}}`` is the forcing velocity.

    energy_transfer_matrix(iter::VortexFilamentSolver, Nk::Integer; quad = nothing) -> (ks, transfers)
    energy_transfer_matrix(iter::VortexFilamentSolver, ks::AbstractVector; quad = nothing) -> (ks, transfers)

Compute energy transfers between different Fourier shells.

Returns a square antisymmetric matrix of dimensions `(Nk + 1, Nk + 1)` where `Nk` is the length of
the returned `ks` vector (which might be smaller than the input `Nk`, if there are not
enough resolved wavenumbers). Note that the `ks` vector does not include the mode `k = 0`.

This function defines `Nk + 1` shells, such that the `i`-th shell contains wavenumbers `ks[i - 1] < k ≤ ks[i]`,
with the conventions `ks[0] = 0` and `ks[Nk + 1] = ∞`. In other words, the last "shell"
contains all small wavenumbers `k > ks[end]`.

See [`energy_flux`](@ref) for more details on the accepted arguments.

## Definitions

The energy transfer between Fourier shells A and B is defined as

```math
T_{AB} = \frac{Γ}{V} ∮ \left[ \bm{s}' × \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{\text{A}} \right] ⋅ \bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{\text{B}} \, \mathrm{d}ξ,
```

where ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{\text{A}}`` and ``\bm{v}_{\text{s}}^{\text{B}}`` are Fourier
band-pass-filtered fields, including only the coefficients within the chosen shells.
