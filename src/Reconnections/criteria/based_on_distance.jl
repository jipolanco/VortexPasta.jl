    ReconnectBasedOnDistance(d_crit; max_passes = 1, use_velocity = (max_passes == 1), decrease_length = true, cos_max = 0.97)

Reconnects filament segments which are at a distance `d < d_crit`.

# Optional keyword arguments

- `use_velocity`: if `true` (default), use filament velocity information in reconnections.
  For now, this is used to discard a reconnection between two points if they are
  instantaneously getting away from each other. If `max_passes > 1`, then `use_velocity` **must**
  be set to `false`.

- `max_passes`: maximum number of scans through all segment pairs to detect and perform
  reconnections. In a single pass, a filament can only be reconnected at most once.
  Therefore, this parameter can be useful to make sure that all required reconnections have
  been performed. **Setting `max_passes > 1` also requires `use_velocity = false`.**

- `decrease_length`: if `true` (default), a reconnection will only be performed
  if it will decrease the total filament length. Since, for vortices, the total
  energy is roughly related to the vortex length, this means that reconnections
  should always tend to dissipate energy.

- `cos_max`: allows to disable reconnections of nearly parallel segments. Two segments
  are considered to be "nearly parallel" if `cos(θ) > cos_max`.
  The default value `cos_max = 0.97` disables reconnections when the angle between lines
  is ``θ < \\arccos(0.97) ≈ 14°``.
  Note that the angle ``θ`` is signed (it takes values in ``[-1, 1]``).
  Negative angles mean that the segments are antiparallel, and in this case reconnections are always performed.
